# Sign Language Recognition using CNN  

## Overview  
This was my **quick undergraduate project**, where I collected a **custom dataset using my camera and OpenCV** to recognize hand signs.  
I built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that differentiated between multiple sign language gestures with high accuracy.  

The work was later **published in IEEE** and has received **20+ academic citations**.
